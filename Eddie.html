            Welcome to my first webpage, where I will practice html and CSS. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is a <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=paragraph%20definition"> paragraph </a>, made by using the paragragh opening and closing tags in html. Inside the word "paragraph" is a link to the definition of paragraph. Made possible by placing the word in between the link tags, which I can't write out, or they will turn into links! 
        </p>
        <p>
            In this paragraph there is an image, with a link in it. Made possible by wrapping and img src tag in link tags.
