    <H2>About me</H2>
        <p>I was born in Burlingame, CA, and go to school in San Francisco <br>
    I enjoy playing tennis and water polo.

<H3>I think Dinosaurs are awesome!</H3>
    <p>It's important to note that dinosaurs are still alive, because birds are the direct descendants of behemoths like T-Rex. So every time you see <a href=https://www.google.com/search?q=bird&espv=2&biw=1423&bih=725&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0CAYQ_AUoAWoVChMIpsevsZK7yAIVTZqICh1QkAn_#tbm=isch&q=Hawk&imgrc=l2A3T3xyvcxgkM%3A> a bird</a>, you should know that it's related to <a href=http://res.cloudinary.com/dk-find-out/image/upload/q_80,w_1440/Velociraptor_u4hjbq.jpg> this </a><</p>

        <h4> This is my first website and I'm excited to make more!</h4>
